# Admin Email Reply System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Admin Email Reply System for the Contact Form and Feedback Management. This enhancement allows administrators to send email responses directly to customers from the admin panel.

## System Enhancement

### Email Functionality Integration

The system now integrates with the existing email infrastructure used for order notifications and other system communications.

#### Email Configuration

**Location**: `backend/controllers/contactController.js`

**Email Setup**:
```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Email configuration
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER || 'shami537uet@gmail.com',
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS || 'vjlk swal olbh bopt'
  }
});

const sendEmail = async (to, subject, html) => {
  try {
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: process.env.EMAIL_USER || 'shami537uet@gmail.com',
      to,
      subject,
      html
    });
    console.log('Email sent successfully to:', to);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Email sending failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

```

## Workflow Enhancement

### Admin Response Process

2. **Clicks "Respond" button** to open response modal
3. **Views original customer message** with full context
4. **Writes response** in the textarea with clear email indicators
5. **Clicks "Send Email Response"** button
6. **Confirms email sending** via confirmation dialog
7. **System updates status** to "resolved" and saves response
8. **Email is automatically sent** to customer with professional template
9. **Admin receives confirmation** that email was sent successfully

### Email Content Structure

}
```

**Response includes email confirmation**:
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Contact updated successfully and response email sent",
